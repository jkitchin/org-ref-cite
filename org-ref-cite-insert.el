;;; Commentary:
;;
;; Provides an insert processor for `org-cite' that is based on
;; `bibtex-completion' for the candidates, and `ivy' for completion. It also
;; provides `ivy-bibtex' actions.
;;
;; I spent a long time trying to find a way to avoid the dependency on `ivy-read'
;; here, and concluded that is is not possible. The issue is that I want to be
;; able to insert one or more citations from a single call to `org-cite-insert',
;; with the following behavior:
;;
;; 1. RET always inserts the current or marked entries and ends the completion.
;; 2. You can sequentially insert entries one at a time without ending
;; completion using keys like C-M-m/n/p
;; 3. You can mark entries without inserting them, and insert at the end when you
;; press RET.
;; 4. If you need an alternate action instead of inserting, you should be able
;; to be able to call it, with or without closing completion. For example, if
;; you want to open the notes/pdf/url of a candidate to check something before
;; inserting it.
;;
;; All four are necessary (IMO) and that can only reasonably be accomplished
;; with `ivy-read'. I do not see a way to use `completing-read' to get the
;; behavior described above.
